        <p>No, it is not mandatory for students to apply to universities for admission through education agents; they can submit their admission applications by their own. However, most of the students fail to understand the process, make mistakes in application and become unsuccessful in securing a place as per their requirements. Additionally, some students prepare poorly for visa applications and interviews – this often results in visa refusal.</p>
        
        <p>A good education consultant can help you to choose the right course at the right institution with right directions foryour academic and career progressions. They can provide you one-stop services and save you time,money and from accidental/wrong decisions. They earn synergic benefits for youfrom your investment in the higher education overseas.</p>

        <p>Earlier is better - we suggest that you start preparation for overseas university admission at least 6 months before the course start date if not earlier. Once you make an informed and firm decision, you should submit your admission application shortly so that you have enough time to allow for sending further documents or information to university if required. It will also give you ample time to fulfil conditions of the conditional offer comfortably, get unconditional offer letter timely and lodge visa applications without delay. Rushing with admission and visa application withing short span of time and at the eleventh hour may put you under pressure and the whole experience may be unpleasant.</p>
